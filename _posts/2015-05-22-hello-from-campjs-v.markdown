I'm writing this from [CampJS V](http://campjs.com)! At this event, I'm adding a blog to my site.

Blogging is something I've wanted to do for a while, there's been an `add-blog` branch in the repository housing my website for two years!

Today I finally rebased it, bringing it up to speed with the numerous changes to the site (surprisingly, it merged cleanly!).
