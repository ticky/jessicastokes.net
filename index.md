Hi there! I'm an Australian software developer in Vancouver, Canada.

I **love** technology and I'm always looking for new and better ways to use it.

I [blog about various things](/blog) occasionally.

There are a lot of open source projects I tinker with or contribute to. You can peruse my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/{{ site.data.accounts.github }}), or have a look at my [(outdated) list of personal open-source projects](/examples/).

{% if site.data.hireable %}
I'm currently available for hire! Feel free to check out [my CV](/cv/).
{% endif %}

### Contact

Feel free to contact me via [email](mailto:{{ site.data.accounts.email }}) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/{{ site.data.accounts.twitter }}).
