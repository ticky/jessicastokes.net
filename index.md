## Welcome.

I **love** technology and IÊ¼m always looking for new and better ways to use it.

I actively contribute to open-source projects; I have a list of [my personal open-source projects](examples.html), or you may choose to peruse the slightly less documented depths of my [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/u/geoffstokes) or [GitHub](https://github.com/geoffstokes) repositories.

I am currently employed as a web developer.

## Contact
Feel free to contact me via [email](mailto:hello@geoffstokes.net) or [twitter](https://twitter.com/geoffstokes).
