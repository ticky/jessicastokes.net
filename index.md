## Welcome.

I **love** the web and the kinds of things we can do with emerging web technologies.

I actively contribute to projects [on GitHub](https://github.com/geoffstokes), and I'm always looking for new and better ways to use technology.

Please feel free to take a look at my [GitHub repositories](https://github.com/geoffstokes), or take a look at [a handful of my personal open-source projects](examples.html).

I'm currently employed as a front-end web developer.

## Contact
Feel free to contact me via [email](mailto:hello@geoffstokes.net) or [twitter](https://twitter.com/geoffstokes).
