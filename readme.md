# Jessica Stokes' Website

A simple Jekyll-based site. Replaces an entirely static site which existed from 2009 to 2013.

## Requirements

This site uses [`rbenv`](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv#installation) to manage Ruby versions, and [Bundler](http://bundler.io) for gem management.

## Building

In order to build you will need `rbenv` running in your shell, and to switch into the project directory.

To install dependencies, `bundle install`.

Once dependencies are installed, run `bundle exec jekyll serve -w`, and the site will be available on port `4000`.
