# Geoff Stokes' Website

A simple Jekyll-based site. Replaces an entirely static site which existed from 2009 to 2013.

## Building

Requires nothing more than a basic installation of [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com).

Just run `jekyll serve -w` from the main directory and the site will be available on port `4000`.
