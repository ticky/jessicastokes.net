# Jessica Stokes' Website

A simple Cobalt-based site, since 2019. Initially a Jekyll site, replacing an entirely static site which existed from 2009 to 2013.

## Requirements

This site uses [`Cobalt`](http://cobalt-org.github.io), and thus requires [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) to be installed.

## Building

You'll need [Rust installed](https://rustup.rs).

Once Rust is installed, `cargo install cobalt-bin --features pagination-unstable --version "0.15.4"` to get Cobalt ready to go.

Once Cobalt is installed, run `cobalt`, and the site will be available on port `3000`.
