# Jessica Stokes' Website

A simple Jekyll-based site. Replaces an entirely static site which existed from 2009 to 2013.

## Requirements

Currently built against Jekyll 2.5.3. Looking to streamline this and make it more predictable (and upgrade to a newer version!) in the future.

## Building

Run `jekyll serve -w` from the main directory and the site will be available on port `4000`.
