Identity, for me at least, has been a strange, challenging thing.

This may come as no surprise, but my [@grapegravity](https://twitter.com/grapegravity) Twitter account is _not_ where I spend a majority of my time on Twitter. I have another account, which has amassed, at the time of writing, over 50,000 Tweets, nearly 400 followers, and organically grown into a social outlet for me that @grapegravity never got the chance to.

As a trans woman in the tech industry, I spent a long time juggling this "public" identity as well as an "exploring who I am" identity. For a time, this felt very necessary and helpful. Stuff I wanted to share with coworkers and tech industry folk would go to the former, and I could vent (yes, sometimes about work) and be very open on the latter.

When you're struggling with your voice, struggling with your identity, struggling to even assert to yourself that the "you" that you feel is _a real thing_, having a place providing you pseudonymity is an amazing opportunity, and served me well.

Recently, however, it's become obvious that this separation isn't doing a great deal for me. Each time I held down Tweetbot's Retweet button and Retweeted a Tweet from both accounts, I'd find myself bothered that I even had to.

I'm becoming increasingly social within (and outside) the industry, and the inactivity on what has become the de facto standard social environment is starting to feel like a poor view of who and what I am. @grapegravity has awkwardly few Tweets for a girl who describes herself as "a bit of a Twitter addict," avoids following many of the people I do interact with to avoid crosstalk, and is now feeling like an awkward, now-pointless aberration of a time long gone.

So, now, I think it's time to drop the fa√ßade.

**My Twitter account is [@ticky](https://twitter.com/ticky).**

It's much more active, a bit more raw, covers more topics, and is nearly infinitely more "_me_." Sometimes it's technical, sometimes it's flirty, sometimes it's complaining about the [Weeribee line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Werribee_railway_line), and sometimes it can be _a touch_ lewd, but hey, this is who and what I am.

Likewise, my [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/u/ticky) and [GitHub](https://github.com/ticky) profiles have been updated to use this handle (interestingly, this was my original GitHub handle, back before I started using GitHub for work purposes).
