I'm writing this from [CampJS V](http://campjs.com)! At this event, I'm adding a blog to my site.

Blogging is something I've wanted to do for a while, there's been an `add-blog` branch in the repository housing my website for two years.

Today I finally rebased it, bringing it up to speed with the numerous changes to the site (surprisingly, it merged cleanly!).

I've added some posts which were rescued from a long-defunct blog of mine. They're rough, written by a much less mature me, and from a vastly different perspective. Hey, it might be interesting!

The posts are;

* [Pseudo Administrator]({% post_url 2009-02-03-pseudo-administrator %})
* [High School Programming]({% post_url 2009-02-16-high-school-programming %})
* [Sharing Steam Games between Operating Systems]({% post_url 2009-08-01-sharing-steam-games-between-operating-systems %})
